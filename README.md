# WebDevBootcamp

A repo to store all projects worked on while completing Colt Steele's 'Web Developer Bootcamp' Udemy course. The course guides the student through a Full-Stack curriculum including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, Express, MongoDB and more...

I would highly recommend the course to anyone interested in Web Development, Colt has a very friendly teaching style and is adept at breaking down complex topics.
